# Drum

VIEW WEB PAGE HERE ----   https://zachschm.github.io/Drum/

This is my second project using JS. The webpage is a basic drum set emulator that plays audio files based on mouse and 
keyboard feedback. This was my first time using audio files within a web page; it was very fun to mess around with. The
highlights of this project include user defined functions, built-in functions: time-out function, event listeners, 
class list modifiers, additional use of query selectors, and the play audio function. This is the first project in 
which I am learning how to trigger JS functions based on user input.
